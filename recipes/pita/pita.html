    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pita bread is people's favourite for ramadan! Try this recipe and share your pitas with friends and family.</p>


    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Bread flour</li>
        <li>Salt and sugar</li>
        <li>Rapid rise yeast (aka fast action yeast) – this dried yeast is mixed directly into the flour and doesn’t require activating first</li>
        <li>Plant milk – I used Pea Protein milk alternative which I recently got hooked on. It even froths up if you want to make a latte so I now always have some in my fridge!</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>Semolina (for the baking tray) or just flour</li>
        <li>Oat or soy cream for brushing</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the bread flour, salt, sugar, and rapid rise yeast.</li>
        <li>Slowly add the plant milk and olive oil while mixing to form a soft dough.</li>
        <li>Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 10 minutes until smooth and elastic.</li>
        <li>Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 hour or until doubled in size.</li>
        <li>Punch down the dough and divide it into equal portions. Roll each portion into a round flat disc.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 230°C (450°F) and place a baking tray inside to heat up.</li>
        <li>Dust the hot baking tray with semolina or flour and carefully place the pita rounds on it.</li>
        <li>Bake for about 5–7 minutes until they puff up and turn golden.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven and brush with oat or soy cream for extra softness.</li>
        <li>Let cool slightly and enjoy your homemade pita bread!</li>
      </ol>
